Some notes :

There was an error in your spread sheet  product_b  i think it was ... 

I used  rspec for the controller specs  and a unit test for the page model.

I used a few different ideas to show some different skills, and knowledge of different assert statements etc. 

I used the rails default 404 page for the 404 
I assumed the page to display the page was show_page 

I've used the nested set model plugin as I have discussed with you. This has a cost for updates, however depending on the situation it has great select speed inprovement, for example moving part of a tree. E.g .  move page product_a to the top level with all its childrens. 

Obviously this is really old issue (trees in sql), so depending on the situation I would pick the correct one, and test it with data. In a CMS generally page layout is updated only from time to time, however calls to find nodes fot a menu, are frequent. The NestedSetModel  speeds up queries for this kind of query.   


The find_by_url only generates one SQL query. (I forgot to add a santize sql function in there i just noticed...)

One other option to consider would be a memory cache like { :hashed_key_of_path => page_id  }

There is a USE_PATH_CACHE in the page model  TRUE or FALSE, depending on if you want to use the cached page to speed up the query

The page_cache column is updated on save.
